  title: "Never Say Never: how I ended up in my dream job as a software engineer at Eventbrite"
  description: "There comes that moment where one realizes 'oh, I am now doing the thing I swore I would never, ever, EVER do'.  In this case, it turns out to be a happily ever after. Hanah will recount how she started out wanting to be a pirate historian, swore to her mother that she would never be a software engineer, and now ended up as - you guessed it - a software engineer.  There’s a certain humility in being surprised by one’s life journey, and where it can go. Hanah will also talk about more serious and important things, like the power of education and using privilege to raise up those around you.  But there will also most likely (actually, definitely) be lots of gifs. "
